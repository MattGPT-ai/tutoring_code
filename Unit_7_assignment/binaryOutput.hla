//Programmer Name: Iman Arfa-Zanganeh
//Course Number: Section 1705
//Date: July 7, 2019
//Purpose: Prompt user for int8 value to be inspected and then printed out in its binary format
//Input: int8 signed value 
//Output: Binary format of int8 value

_inputValue : int8 := 0; //Purpose: stores the int8 value inputted by the user that will eventually be printed in binary format

//Purpose: Print out the binary format of _inputValue using the carry bit found within the EFLAGS register and the LAHF instruction  
//Description of parameters: _inputValue is an int8 value that will store user input; CH is an 8 bit register that will temporarily hold _inputValue; AH is an 8 bit register that will hold _inputValue in its binary format, which will ultimately be printed out
//Description of return values: N/A
//Input: in8 signed value that will be stored in _inputValue.
//Output: Binary format of int8 value
